# html-and-css
<h1>This repo is used for understanding basics of html and css</h1><br>
In html and css we are not going to use all the functions in our project. <br>
Hence, In this repository we are going to learn and use some of thr most common and most used tags and function important for out projects.<br>


To start first we need to know how an html file is created-
    For creating an html file we simply have to create a new file with extension ".html".
    for example, i want to create a file with name "index", so for that i will open a new file name it as "index" with extension ".html" and save it - "index.html".
html has a fixed stucture without that we cannot run the file,since we use "vs code" for coding. vs code have a shortcut for getting the structure or we can also call it as the boiler plate code of html-
    simply type 
    "shift+! and enter"
    this will give us the boiler plate code
now you can use this code and do further development in it.
important tags that we usually use -
1)h1-h6- these are heading tags used to show heading in this h1 is the biggest and h6 is the smallest tag
    for example- 
        <h1>see text size</h1>
        <h2>see text size</h2>
        <h3>see text size</h3>
        <h4>see text size</h4>
        <h5>see text size</h5>
        <h6>see text size</h6>
2)p tag- this tag is used to write long sentenses or used to write paragraphs 
    for example-
        <p>this is a paragrph tag i am writing a paragrph in it</p>
3)br tag- this tag is also called as break tag we use it to break a line or go to next line 
    for eg- in this line i placed a br tag <br> see now you can see these words come on next line
