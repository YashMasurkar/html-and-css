<pre>
<h1>This repo is used for understanding basics of html and css</h1><br>
In html and css we are not going to use all the functions in our project. <br>
Hence, In this repository we are going to learn and use some of thr most common and most used tags and function important for out projects.<br>

<h1>HTML</h1>
To start first we need to know how an html file is created-
    For creating an html file we simply have to create a new file with extension ".html".
    for example, i want to create a file with name "index", so for that i will open a new file name it as "index" with extension ".html" and save it - "index.html".
html has a fixed stucture without that we cannot run the file,since we use "vs code" for coding. vs code have a shortcut for getting the structure or we can also call it as the boiler plate code of html-
    simply type 
    "shift+! and enter"
    this will give us the boiler plate code
now you can use this code and do further development in it.
important tags that we usually use -
1)h1-h6- these are heading tags used to show heading in this h1 is the biggest and h6 is the smallest tag
    for example- 
        <h1>see text size</h1>
        <h2>see text size</h2>
        <h3>see text size</h3>
        <h4>see text size</h4>
        <h5>see text size</h5>
        <h6>see text size</h6>
2)p tag- this tag is used to write long sentenses or used to write paragraphs 
    for example-
        <p>this is how a paragrph tag look, i am writing a paragrph in it</p>
3)br tag- this tag is also called as break tag we use it to break a line or go to next line 
    for eg- in this line i placed a br tag <br> see now you can see these words come on     next line
4)div tag - div is a rectangle which has no hight but full width.height of main div tag is equal to total height of its childrens.
    for eg - see the file div.html its a perfect example of div tag
5)id - id is an attribute in html it provides an unique identifier for an element.
In css we use id to target an element.
    for eg - see index.html file there we have used id to target in that file we used inline css
6)class -class is also an attribute which we use to target an element like id 
the key difference is that class is like a category which we can assign to multiple elements and id is unique for each element.
    for eg - see index .html there we used class to target more than one element.
7)img tag - It is used to include or add images in html file. it have alt attribute in that we give info about image this is shown if the image is not shown properly by browser.
    for eg - see index .html there we used image tag to add image in html file
8)a tag- it is used to link a page with our page.
    for eg- you can see "index.html" file. In the file we have link "link.html" file with "index.html" file by using "a tag".
